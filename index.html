<!-- ================= QUESTIONS START HERE ================= -->

<!-- QUESTIONS WILL BE INSERTED IN BLOCKS -->
 <!-- Question 1 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>1) A 24 year old pregnant woman receives the results of her 12 week combined test. Which of the following results would indicate a higher risk of Down syndrome?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Decreased Nuchal translucency</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Increased PAPP-A</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Increased AFP (α-fetoprotein)</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Increased β-hCG</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p><strong>Correct answer: Increased β-hCG</strong></p>
    <p>β-hCG is increased in trisomy 21. In trisomy 21, remember “HIgh” for High levels of “H”cg and “I”nhibin A.</p>
    <p>In the 12 week combined test, β-hCG and PAPP-A and nuchal translucency are tested.</p>
    <p>In the 20 week quadruple test, AFP, β-hCG, uE3 and inhibin A are tested.</p>
    <p>Remember the down syndrome results:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase in β-hCG</li>
      <li>Decrease in PAPP-A</li>
      <li>Increased nuchal translucency</li>
      <li>Decreased AFP</li>
      <li>Decreased uE3</li>
      <li>Increased inhibin A</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<!-- Question 2 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>2) A 5 year old boy presents to the GP with frequent chest infections and stomach pains. He is evidently short of breath and has been coughing repeatedly. His mother mentions that his stool appears light coloured, oily and floats in the toilet bowl. What is the most appropriate option as a first line and immediate investigation for this patient?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Chloride sweat test</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Genetic testing for CFTR gene</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Heel prick blood test</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">High resolution CT thorax</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>The most likely diagnosis is cystic fibrosis. When presented in the community, the firstline investigation is a chloride sweat test due to its high specificity. Sweat is triggered by pilocarpine (a muscarinic agonist) and will be unusually high in chloride levels due to CFTR dysfunction.</p>
    <p>Genetic testing would be more definitive but is not a standard firstline investigation.</p>
    <p>The heel prick blood test is done for newborn babies at 5 days. This child is 5 years too old.</p>
    <p>A high resolution CT thorax is not indicated in cystic fibrosis. It can be indicated for cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 3 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>3) The investigation comes back positive for cystic fibrosis. What is the most likely gene mutation that has occurred</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Triplet Deletion in chromosome 7</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Point Deletion of a single base pair in chromosome 6</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Nonsense mutation in chromosome 6</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Triplet Insertion in chromosome 7</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>The most common mutation in cystic fibrosis is del F508 which is a deletion of a triplet of base pairs on chromosome 7 resulting in the loss of phenylalanine from the CFTR protein. The dysfunctional CFTR protein is unable to travel to the cell surface.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 4 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>4) A known HIV-positive patient comes to the hospital for a routine blood test. He has poor adherence to his ART therapy and his CD4 count is 145 cells/µL. The doctor would like to begin antibiotic prophylaxis. Which medication is most likely initiated?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Amoxicillin</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Clarithromycin</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Tazobactam/Piperacillin</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">TMP-SMX (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole)</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>TMP-SMX is first line for prophylaxis against opportunistic infections in patients with poorly controlled HIV and a CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/µL. The most relevant opportunistic infection at this CD4 count is Pneumocystis jirovecii, as it can cause pneumonia and high mortality.</p>
    <p>Although Pneumocystis jirovecii is a fungus, TMP-SMX is able to inhibit its de novo folate synthesis.</p>
    <p>Since Pneumocystis jirovecii is a fungus, penicillins such as amoxicillin and piperacillin will not be effective.</p>
    <p>Pneumocystis also has 80S ribosomes instead of 50s so macrolides like clarithromycin are also ineffective.</p>
    <p>Tazobactam and piperacillin are a combination of antibiotics commonly used in sepsis.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 5 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>5) A medical student is learning about the circulation and breathing mechanism in a foetus. Which of the following statements are true?</strong></p>

  <p>1. The ductus venosus bypasses the lungs and allows for deoxygenated to move straight from the pulmonary artery to the ascending aorta<br>
     2. There are two umbilical arteries and only one umbilical vein<br>
     3. The foramen ovale closes after the baby’s first breath to become the fossa ovalis
  </p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Statements 1, 2, 3</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Statements 1, 2</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Statements 2, 3</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Statement 3 only</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Statement 1 is incorrect because the ductus venosus bypasses the liver, not the lungs. This is done by the ductus arteriosus, connecting the pulmonary artery to the aorta.
</p>
    <p>Recall that the umbilical vein confusingly brings oxygenated blood to the fetus (from the placenta) and the umbilical arteries bring deoxygenated blood back to the mother. This is because they technically belong to the fetus and thus are named appropriately to whether they are travelling to or from the fetus' heart.
</p>
    <p>If the foramen ovale does not close, it can lead to PFO (Patent Foramen Ovale) which can be asymptomatic or cause paradoxical embolisms.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 6 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>6) An 18 year old girl comes into the GP explaining how she feels concerned about a notable lack of breast development. After further questioning she reveals that she has not yet began to menstruate. She has webbing skin between the neck and shoulders and a short stature. Which genetic karyotype is most likely to cause this presentation?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">46 XX</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">47 XYY</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">45 XO</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">47 XXY</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>45 XO is the karyotype known as Turner’s syndrome. It is the most common cause of primary amenorrhea and physically present with a short stature, webbed neck and low set ears. There are no preventive measures available for this condition. Hormone replacement of growth hormone, oestrogen and progesterone can provide some symptomatic management.</p>
    <p>46 XX is the normal karyotype for a woman.</p>
    <p>47 XYY is Jacobs syndrome. Individuals are male and can be asymptomatic. Those that present with symptoms can be taller than average and can have delayed intellectual development.</p>
    <p>47 XXY is Klinefelter’s syndrome. Individuals are male and are often taller than normal with longer limbs. They can have delayed or incomplete sexual organ development with decreased pubic hair and potential gynaecomastia.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 7 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>7) Constipation is very common during pregnancy as early as the first trimester and is often worse around the second or third month. What is the physiological mechanism behind constipation during pregnancy?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Surge in βhCG produced by the placenta after implantation</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Progesterone produced by the corpus luteum</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Rising oestrogen levels reducing bowel motility</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Increased red blood cell production causing increased vascularisation of the gut</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Elevated progesterone levels secreted predominantly from the corpus luteum decrease peristaltic activity of gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells.</p>
    <p>The surge in βhCG is strongly associated to morning sickness.</p>
    <p>Oestrogen does not have a large role in bowel motility during pregnancy and neither does increased RBC production.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 8 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>8) A group of 1st year medical students are working on a project about the most common genes associated with breast cancer. The genes they are working on are a pair of tumour suppressor genes that normally help repair double stranded DNA breaks. What is the inheritance pattern of these two gene mutations?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Autosomal Dominant</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Autosomal Recessive</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">X-Linked Dominant</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">X-Linked Recessive</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>The most common gene mutations of breast cancer are BRCA1 and BRCA2. They have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 9 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>9) Which term best describes a new, irreversible, and autonomous proliferation of cells, which persists independently of the original stimulus and is seen in tumours?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Hyperplasia</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Dysplasia</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Neoplasia</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Metaplasia</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Neoplasia is the final stage of a tumour becoming a carcinoma. It is the new, irreversible, autonomous proliferation of cells that can be well differentiated or abnormal. This means neoplasia can be benign or malignant.

</p><p>Hyperplasia is the proliferation of the number of cells and is not always pathological (e.g. thickening of the uterus in the luteal phase)

</p><p>Metaplasia is the reversible changing of cell type with another cell type. For example, GERD can cause stratified squamous cells to be replaced by columnar epithelium in a condition known as Barrett’s oesophagus.

</p><p>Dysplasia is the precancerous disordered growth and maturation of epithelial cells. It is potentially reversible if the inciting stimulus is removed. Think of it as “just before cancer”.
</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 10 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>10) Once an antibody attaches to a surface antigen on a bacteria, which region of the antibody interacts with phagocytes such as macrophages and neutrophils to initiate phagocytosis?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Fc region (fragment of crystallization)</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Fab region (fragment of antigen-binding)</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Hinge region</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Variable region</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>The Fc region is the stem of the antibody that phagocytes can bind to. It’s the end that is always shaped like a stick/line.

<p>The Fab region is the region that binds to the antigen, consisting of one light chain and a portion of a heavy chain.

</p><p>The hinge region is a stretch of heavy chains between Fc and Fab regions that looks like a hinge.

</p><p>The variable region is the part of an antibody's polypeptide chain that has a unique amino acid sequence and forms the antigen-binding site
</p>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- Question 11 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>11) A 12 year old boy lands on an outstretched hand in an attempt to break his fall whilst skateboarding. The clinician identifies a “dinner fork” deformity and comes to the diagnosis of a Colles Fracture. Which of the following locations is this fracture present?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">5th metacarpal and trapezium</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Distal Radius</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Proximal Radius</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Distal humerus</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>A Colles fracture is a fracture of the distal radius, most commonly caused due to a fall of the outstretched hand. This topic appeared in my sem test 2 years ago.</p>
    <p>Note the 5th metacarpal and trapezium are not near each other, but a fracture of the 5th metacarpal is common in boxing.</p>
    <p>A fracture of the proximal radius (usually of the radial head) is a common fracture of the elbow, particularly in children and the elderly. This can also be caused by falling on an outstretched hand but the dinner fork abnormality is pathognomonic for a Colles fracture.</p>
    <p>A fracture of the distal humerus accounts for 30% of elbow fractures.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 12 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>12) The pudendal nerve exits the pelvic cavity via which foramen?</strong></p>

  
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Lesser sciatic foramen</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Obturator Foramen</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Pelvic brim</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Greater sciatic foramen</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>The pudendal nerve exits the pelvic cavity via the greater sciatic foramen, below the piriformis muscles. It then reenters via the lesser sciatic foramen to innervate the pelvic floor muscles, sphincter muscles and provide sensation to the perineum.</p>
    <p>The obturator foramen is positioned anteriorly (compared to the posterior sciatic foramina) and contains the obturator nerve and membrane.</p>
    <p>The pelvic brim is an anatomical landmark marking the boundary between the true and false pelvis. It is not a foramen.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 13 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>13) A 30 year old woman who is attempting to conceive purchases a urine test from Sainsbury’s. Which hormone surge indicates that she is ovulating?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">LH</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">FSH</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Oestrogen</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">β-hCG</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>An LH surge triggers ovulation and LH level drop back down immediately after</p>
    <p>FSH also rises during ovulation but not nearly as high.</p>
    <p>Oestrogen has a pre LH surge that causes the surge in LH. However this surge plateaus and is unreliable in tracking menstrual cycle</p>
    <p>β-hCG released from the syncytiotrophoblast cells in the placenta and is used to detect pregnancy</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 14 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>14) Which of the following statements about bone homeostasis are true?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Bone homeostasis is an example of a positive feedback loop</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Calcitonin released from the thyroid glands act to increase calcium levels in the blood</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Osteoprotegerin (OPG) acts to reduces bone resorption by inhibiting the activation of osteoclasts</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Osteoporosis is an issue with a deficiency in collagen causing defunct bone homeostasis</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Osteoprotegerin (OPG) acts as a decoy, binding to RANKL which would otherwise bind to RANK on osteoclast precursors, activating them.</p>
    <p>Calcitonin is released from the thyroid glands but decreases calcium levels</p>
    <p>Bone homeostasis is an example of a negative feedback loop</p>
    <p>Osteoporosis is an issue with defunct bone homeostasis but is not a collagen deficiency issue. It is caused by osteoclast activity outweighing osteoblast activity due to factors such as aging, menopause, steroid use, genetics and lifestyle factors</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 15 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>15) Which of the following individuals most accurately meets the clinical definition of frailty?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">An 88 year old woman who remains active, walks 2 miles daily, and has slight hypertension</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">A 76 year old man with multiple comorbidities who becomes acutely confused and immobile after a mild urinary tract infection.</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">A 40 year old woman with severe depression and social withdrawal but normal physical health.</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">A 33 year old bilateral leg amputee who uses prostheses and works full-time with well-controlled hypertension.</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Frailty is defined as a high vulnerability to health stressors and a reduced ability to recover from them due to a loss of inbuilt reserves. The 76 year old man best describes this definition as a mild UTI causes confusion and immobility which is an unusually adverse reaction.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 16 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>16) A 45 year old type 1 diabetic takes insulin before her meal. How does this drug act on tissues at a cellular level?</strong></p>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Addison’s disease is most commonly an autoimmune disorder causing adrenal insufficiency.</p>
    <p>Cushing’s disease where a benign tumour in the pituitary gland causes overproduction of ACTH, overstimulating the adrenal glands to produce excess cortisol. Notably, Cushing’s disease is different to Cushing’s syndrome. Cushing’s syndrome is the set of effects caused by excess cortisol and Cushing’s syndrome is the specific cause of Cushing’s syndrome - a pituitary adenoma.</p>
    <p>Adrenal crisis is a life threatening medical emergency occurs when the body’s cortisol levels drop dangerously low, often caused by infection or chronic steroid therapy</p>
    <p>Pheochromocytoma is tumour on the adrenal gland causing excess catecholamines (primarily adrenaline) causing the 5 P’s – Pain (headache), Pallor, Pressure (hypertension), Palpitations, Perspiration</p>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Aphthous ulcers are mouth ulcers and are common in the general population but not necessarily linked to CF. Even if you do not know what aphthous ulcers are, try answer these types of questions via process of elimination. However, as a rule of thumb for future exams the answer is usually not the one you have never heard of.</p>
    <p>Diabetes occurs due to pancreatic blockage from thick mucus.</p>
    <p>Meconium ileus is an abnormally thick, sticky first stool from a newborn. 90% of the time it occurs due to CF, as the sticky mucus prevents water from thinning the stool. It is one of the first manifestations of CF.</p>
    <p>Sperm infertility occurs in CF due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (spermatic duct). Sperm production is normal but there is no sperm canal.</p>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Apoptosis is programmed, controlled cell death by the 2 main routes that converge to activate caspases which are cell death messengers.</p>
    <p>Necrosis is messy, uncontrolled, unintentional cell death</p>
    <p>Autophagy is degradation of cellular componenents within autophagosomes (self-eating).</p>
    <p>Entosis is a form of cell cannibalism where one cell engulfs a neighbouring cell in a programmed manner. The engulfed cell dies.</p>

    <p>Here a multilaminar primary follicle can be seen on the left alongside a couple of primordial follicles on the right. These follicles are distinctly only seen in ovaries.</p>
    <p>A fallopian tube would have a multi-pronged shaped lumen lined by simple columnar epithelium containing ciliated peg cells. There would be 3 distinct layers: mucosa, muscularis and serosa.</p>
    <p>Ectocervix has stratified squamous epitheium which transitions to inner endocervix which is lined by mucus-producing columnar epithelium. Cervix will always appear as a border to a wide lumen. </p>
    <p>The vagina's histology features a non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium over a lamina propria and a muscularis layer.  </p>

    <p>The ureter passes very close to the ovary as it travels through the pelvic brim beneath the ovarian vessels</p>
    <p>The left renal vein runs much more superior at L1</p>
    <p>The uterine artery runs very close to the ureter near the cervix and here the ureter is at risk during hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) instead.</p>
    <p>The external iliac artery is not within the surgical field of the ovary. It is hard to picture, this is a tricky but textbook question (it came up when I was in Y1 and I got it wrong)</p>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>You should know that a patent foramen ovale connects the right and left atria. Therefore a clot travelling from the right to the left side of the heart is the only option that aligns with this condition. This is known as a paradoxical embolism where a blood clot from the venous system (like in a DVT) travels into the arterial system by skipping the lungs via the patent foramen ovale.</p>
    <p>Right ventricular hypertrophy occurring due to a hardened pulmonary valve is known as pulmonary stenosis.</p>
    <p>Regurgitation of the mitral valve is mitral regurgitation</p>
    <p>Deoxygenated blood in the lungs is a normal physiological event.</p>

    <p>The process of meiosis I is where chromosome number halves and haploid cells are first seen. Diploid primary spermatocytes (2n) undergo meiosis I to produce haploid secondary spermatocytes (1n). These then undergo meiosis II to produce double the number of spermatids (1n) which mature into spermatozoa (sperm cells).</p>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Luteinizing hormone acts directly on Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone</p>
    <p>Testosterone normally boosts IGF1, so the other way around</p>
    <p>FSH primarily stimulates sperm production in males</p>
    <p>Testosterone is primarily regulated through negative feedback. High testosterone levels inhibits its own release.</p>
